To start the YAML file for the Docker Stack of Services

$ docker stack deploy -c <YAML file name> <give the service a name>

example

$ docker stack deploy -c my-docker-stack.yml votingapp

The "-c" flag stands for compose: Remember docker swarm stack commands ignore the build commands, there
should be no build commands in a stack YAML file for Docker Stacks. 
The keyword rather is "deploy" in the Docker Stack YAML file. 
(In docker-compose files it does build.) But for Swarm, that's a no no. 

After deploying the stack that hosts the service, in this case its a voting application

run 
$ docker stack ls 

The command above will list the services that you deploy 

$ docker stack ps <The name you gave it at deploy>

This command will show what node is running what task. 

$ docker stack services <the deploy name you gave>

This command will show the replicas you have of containers 


To get the full picture of what the entire application is running
$ docker stack services <deployname>
$ docker stack ps <deployname>


Dive into the networking of the application 

run   $ docker network ls 

If you change something in the stack YAML file
run the $ docker stack deploy -c my-docker-stack.yml votingapp 
again so it will update. 

clean up the stack service (web application)

run   $ docker stack rm <theDeployName_youGave>

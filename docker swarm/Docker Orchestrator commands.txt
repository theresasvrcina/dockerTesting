After making a Docker Swarm cluster

run 

$ docker node ls 

This will list the machines/hosts (nodes) in current Docker Swarm.

$ docker node --help 

The above command will list the docker node <flags> that a Docker orchestrator can work with. 

The list of docker node <flags> for example "promote" or "update" help to promote and make manager nodes or update to change nodes to worker nodes. 


$ docker swarm --help 

Also will list the flags that an Orchestrator can use for example "join", "initialize" or "leave".  Those can be used for nodes within a swarm. 

To work with a cluster (swarm)

$ docker service --help

The above command will list how to work with the activities a swarm has or can implement to have. 


Once services are created or docker stacks are deployed. 

$ docker service ls <name_or_ID_of_Service>

This will show the containers running for what was created or deployed.

If wanting more creations or deployments of the same service

scale it up by running

$ docker service update <name_or_ID_of_Service> --replicas 5

Replace the above number with the amount wanting. 

Then to check if the replicated creations or deployments are working run

$ docker service ps <name_or_ID_of_Service>

$ docker update --help 

The above command will output how to update resources in containers for memory, cpu, and more. 

$ docker service update --help 

The above command will give alot more options to work with as well.

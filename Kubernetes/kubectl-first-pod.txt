Similar to docker run command, but things will change in next software updates. (1.18 is a newer version to use)

$ kubectl run <give it a name> --image <offical or custom image name>

an example is 

$ kubectl run pingpong --image alpine ping 1.1.1.1


Then to see the pod run...

$ kubectl get all 


Background story: Inside the pod is running a container 
which is running the above ping command using an alpine linux 
image. 


Things changed is using

$ kubectl create 

rather than  $ kubectl run

Both generate a single pod, but create is used with 1.18 K8's 


To view the logs of the above pingpong pod type the below command

$ kubectl logs <type>/<pod name>

For this example...since I deployed it through the run command
it will be under the deploy folder...

$ kubectl logs deploy/pingpong


If you wanted more replicas of the pod...

$ kubectl scale deploy/pingpong --replicas 3

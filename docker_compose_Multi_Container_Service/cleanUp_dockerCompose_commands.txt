To compose the Docker Orchestration of the multi service YAML file. 

$ docker-compose up

To end the services

$ docker-compose down 

Cleaning up the volumes

$ docker-compose down -v 

The above command will delete all of the volumes that were declared in the volumes 
  section in the docker-compose YAML file, as well as any other files attached to the container. 

To remove all of the images that were built for the container services to work. 
  Using the "all" parameter for the --rmi flag, double think to use all or local parameter instead. 
   
$ docker-compose down --rmi all 

or 

$ docker-compose down --rmi local 

The local parameter for the --rmi flag will only remove images that don't have a custom tag.

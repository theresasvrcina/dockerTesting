After building many images and containers. Cleaning up is very important, so that you can reclaim that memory space. 

In Docker it's called pruning. 

A few commands to use after building and running containers is ...

$ docker image prune 

The above command cleans up images that are lying around in your computer's memory. 

$ docker system prune 

The above command will clean up all of it, but will prompt you if you are sure or not (that's really nice).

One of my favorite commands while using Docker for clean up purposes is the below.

$ docker image prune -a 

It removies the images I am not using. 

Another one of my favorites is ...

$ docker system df 

This lets me see the amount of memory space Docker is using on my computer.
